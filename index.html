                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Airbus A380</strong> is the world's largest passenger airliner, a wide-body aircraft
                    manufactured by Airbus. Airbus studies started in 1988 and the project was announced
                    in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 747 in the long haul market. The A3XX
                    project was presented in 1994; Airbus launched the €9.5 billion <em>($10.7 billion)</em> A380
                    programme on 19 December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse on 18 January
                    2005, with its first flight on 27 April 2005. Difficulties in electrical wiring caused a
                    two-year delay and the development cost ballooned to €18 billion. It obtained its EASA and
                    FAA type certificates on 12 December 2006.</p>
                <p>It was first delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service
                    on 25 October. Production peaked at 30 per year in 2012 and 2014. However, Airbus concedes
                    that its $25 billion investment for the aircraft cannot be recouped. On 14 February 2019,
                    after Emirates reduced its last orders in favour of the A350 and the A330neo, Airbus announced
                    that A380 production would end by 2021.[6]</p>
                <p>The full-length double-deck aircraft has a typical seating capacity of 525, though it
                    is certified for up to 853 passengers. It is powered by four Engine Alliance GP7200 or
                    Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofans providing a range of 8,000 nmi (14,800 km). As of December 2019,
                    Airbus has received 251 firm orders and delivered 242 aircraft; Emirates is the biggest A380
                    customer
                    with 123 ordered, of which 115 have been delivered.</p>

                <h3>Engines</h3>
                <p>The <strong>A380</strong> is offered with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 (A380-841/-842) or the
                    Engine Alliance GP7000 (A380-861) turbofan engines.[156] The Trent 900 is a
                    combination of the 3 m (118 in) fan and scaled IP compressor of the 777-200X/300X
                    Trent 8104 technology demonstrator derived from the Boeing 777's Trent 800, and
                    the Airbus A340-500/600's Trent 500 core. The GP7200 HP core technology is
                    derived from GE's GE90 and its LP sections are based on the PW4000 expertise.[157]
                    At its launch in 2000, engine makers assured Airbus it was getting the best level
                    of technology and they would be state-of-the-art for the next decade, but three
                    years later Boeing launched the 787 Dreamliner with game-changing technology and
                    10% lower fuel burn than the previous generation, to the dismay of John Leahy.[158]</p>
                <p>Due to its modern engines and aerodynamic improvements, Lufthansa's A380s produce
                    half the noise of the Boeing 747-200 while carrying 160 more passengers.[159] In 2012,
                    the A380 received an award from the Noise Abatement Society.[160]</p>
                <p>London Heathrow is a key destination for the A380.[7] The aircraft is below the
                    QC/2 departure and QC/0.5 arrival noise limits under the Quota Count system set by
                    the airport.[161] Field measurements suggest the approach quota allocation for the
                    A380 may be overly generous compared to the older Boeing 747, but still quieter.[162]
                    [163] Rolls-Royce is supporting the CAA in understanding the relatively high A380/Trent
                    900 monitored noise levels.[164] Heathrow's landing charges having a noise component,
                    the A380 is cheaper to land there than a Boeing 777-200 and -300 and it saves $4,300 to
                    $5,200 per landing, or $15.3M to $18.8M of present value over 15 years. Tokyo Narita
                    has a similar noise charge.[165]</p>
                <p>Sufficient braking capacity allowed for thrust reversers to be installed on only
                    the inboard engines.[166][167] The outboard engines lack them, reducing the amount of
                    debris stirred up during landing.[168] The reversers are electrically actuated to save
                    weight, and for greater reliability than pneumatic or hydraulic equivalents.[169]</p>
